/*  Samplers can be though of as 2D shaders. Sampler is a first class citizen in *ugl-rs*,
    think of them as an object, that can be sampled in the normalized unit square.

    Sampler can be anything, that can be sampled such as:
      a fixed color
      a gradient (linear/radial/conic)
      a texture (image)
      effect (mask/clip?)
